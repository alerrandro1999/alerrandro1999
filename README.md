## Welcome
Hello, my name is Alerrandro and I'm a Full Stack programmer. I have knowledge in several programming languages, but currently I'm focused on becoming an expert in PHP and its universe. With experience in Full Stack development, I currently work with mobile development using flutter and dart.

I've been investing my time studying design patterns, clean code, SOLID, and testing, as I know these are key factors in creating quality, maintainable code.

I look for new opportunities to apply my knowledge, especially in PHP. With my skills in Full Stack programming and my experience in mobile development, I believe I can add value in web application projects.
