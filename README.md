## Welcome
Hello, my name is Alerrandro and I'm a Full Stack programmer. I have knowledge in several programming languages, but currently I'm focused on becoming an expert in PHP and its universe. With experience in Full Stack development, I currently work with mobile development using flutter and dart.

I've been investing my time studying design patterns, clean code, SOLID, and testing, as I know these are key factors in creating quality, maintainable code.

I look for new opportunities to apply my knowledge, especially in PHP. With my skills in Full Stack programming and my experience in mobile development, I believe I can add value in web application projects.

[Homepage - Portfolio ](https://alerrandrodev.tech/) - A personal website to promote myself as a developer, I used vue.js to develop and the deployment was carried out at hostinger 

## Projects

- [Portfolio - Alacid Pamplona](https://www.alacidfotografia.com) - A Portfolio for a photographer, to demonstrate his rehearsals and an agenda to get in touch with him. It has a small admin panel so he can modify his schedule.

## Package Composer

- [Package - Return Century](https://github.com/alerrandro1999/alerrandro-returncentury) - A simple PHP package to return the century of the year given.

- Fluttter / Dart / Firebase

> I'm working with Flutter, Dart and Firebase, although I'm still improving my knowledge in these technologies. With Flutter and Dart, I can efficiently and scalably develop mobile apps for iOS and Android using a modern and practical development toolset.
 
- HTML5 / CSS3 / Javascript

> I have skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, which are the markup, style, and programming languages that make up the foundation of the modern web. With HTML, I can create web page structures, while with CSS, I can style those structures to create a visually appealing and consistent look. With Javascript, I can add dynamic and interactive functionality to web pages, making them more responsive and engaging. My HTML, CSS and Javascript skills allow me to create attractive and functional web pages that offer a great user experience.

With my experience in phpMyAdmin, I can manage databases through a user-friendly GUI. I can help companies manage their data efficiently and securely using my skills in various database technologies.
 
- Git Flow / GitLab / BitBucket

> I have skills in Git Flow, GitLab and BitBucket, which are popular Git-based software version control management platforms. With these technologies, I can create code repositories, track source code changes, work together on different branches, and securely merge code. Git Flow is a work methodology that helps to keep a clearer organization of the development flow. GitLab and BitBucket are platforms that offer additional features such as continuous integration, automated testing, continuous deployment, and team collaboration. With my Git Flow, GitLab and BitBucket skills, I can contribute to team software project management, improving efficiency and quality of delivered code.
